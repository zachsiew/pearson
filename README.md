# Note
- For best practice I should have created an api folder specifically for handling http requests route. 
  - I did not implement that here since there is essentially only 2 api calls to the backend.
  
- Could have done a better job to have a better user experience. 
  - For example notifying user and clearing the form when it is successfuly submitted, and having the error message as red color.
